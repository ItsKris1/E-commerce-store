# Brief Introduction
I gave my best to develop an e-commerce store, what would fit standards. I focused on back and front-end equally. Before the project I had really small knowledge of front-end development compared to back-end. I tried to implement the CRUD(create, read, update, delete) feature everywhere where it would be reasonable. Thats all I got to say. Enjoy!

# Instructions to run the project with Django
1. Download the ZIP file and extract it
2. Open the project 
3. Run ``cd E-commerce-store-main ``
4. In the terminal ``` py manage.py migrate ```
5. Create superuser and follow the instructions in the terminal ``` py manage.py createsuperuser ```
6. Run the server ``` py manage.py runserver ```
7. Done! 
8. Make sure to use Superuser for all the features<br><br>
